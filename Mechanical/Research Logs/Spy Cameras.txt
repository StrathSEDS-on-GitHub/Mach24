Looking to include 3 extra cameras if possible
positions as follows

1.Looking down on lowest motor centering ring
size issues:11mm from outer diameter of motor to inner diameter of airframe
(76mm, 54mm)

2.Looking up from highest motor centering ring
size issues:11mm from outer diameter of motor to inner diameter of airframe
(76mm, 54mm)

3.Looking horizontally from nosecose
Easiest to fit, pinhole required during 3d print of nosecone if applicable


Any good value cameras we have found so far fail to fit the criteria of 1 & 2

Spy pens a good next step to look at
i.e.

but vertical camera rather than horizontal :^)
